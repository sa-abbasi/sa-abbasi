- 👋 Hi, I’m Shakeel Ahmed. I am a backend software architect/engineer. I am developing software products since 2005 using SQL Server and.net. I have completed multiple projects using .netcore 3/5/6 since 2018.
- I worked in Meezan Bank IT Department (Karachi, Pakistan) from 2006 to 2011. I developed multiple programs to integrate ATM machines with core banking systems and to execute inter-branch online transactions. 
- I developed windows services to fetch data from more than 300 SQL Server databases from more than 300 geographical locations, stored this data in a central database and then developed data matching queries to reconcile inter-branch transactions. I specially enjoined and loved socket programming and multithreading during my stay at Meezan Bank.
- I left Meezan Bank in 2011 and joined Avanza Solutions, I was part of NCR/iSuite Team in Avanza Solutions where I developed almost 7 products for banking industry during my 10 years in Avanza Solutions. These software products are used to manage ATM machine fleet. These software products are used in Pakistan, Middle East and in Africa by multiple banks.

I have passion to architect software products and services, I analyze ideas, products and then think about their ERDs, design databases, think, design and develop solution components and services using .net core as back end technology and Razor/Blazor/React as front end technologies

I extensively used Jquery, Jquery UI, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript and many other Javascript libraries in my projects. I used Blazor WASM in one of my project and I developed its front end using Blazor WASM and C#. Recently I used MAUI to develop front end of a mobile app.

I worked on Windows Forms and WPF from 2005 to 2014 in multiple desktop projects.
